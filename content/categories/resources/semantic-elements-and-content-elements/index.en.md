After we saw in the previous part [how to use Metadata in HTML](/en/categories/resources/meta-tags-in-html-and-technical-seo), now it’s time to talk about **semantic tags** and the difference between them and **non-semantic tags**.

HTML tags are divided into two main types:

* **Semantic Elements**
* **Non-Semantic Elements**

## The Difference Between Semantic and Non-Semantic Tags

![Difference between semantic and non-semantic tags](/semantic-elements-and-content-elements.webp "Difference between semantic and non-semantic tags")

Semantic elements in HTML are simply **elements that have a clear meaning**, describing their role or the type of content inside them — both for the browser and for the developer reading the code.

For example, when you see a tag like `<header>` or `<footer>`, you immediately understand that it represents the **top section (header)** or the **bottom section (footer)** of the page, without even looking at its inner details.

**Examples of semantic elements:**

* `<article>`: Represents an independent article or post.
* `<nav>`: Contains the website’s navigation links.
* `<section>`: A specific part of the page that groups related content.
* `<header>` and `<footer>`: Represent the page or section header and footer.
* `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`: Used to display images or illustrations with their captions.
* `<main>`: Represents the main content area of the page.

Using these elements makes your code **cleaner and easier to read**, and it also helps search engines and assistive technologies (like screen readers) understand the content more accurately.

In short, semantic elements make your web page **organized, meaningful, and easy to maintain** — both for humans and browsers.

## Uses of Non-Semantic Elements

They can also be called **content or layout tags**. These tags are used to **structure and style the content of the page**.

They don’t add meaning to the content itself, but they help you **organize elements and apply CSS styling** to them easily.

### The `<div>` Tag – General Container Element

The `<div>` tag is **the most commonly used tag in HTML**, and it serves as a **general container** to group multiple elements together, so you can style or control their appearance using CSS or JavaScript.

**Example:**

```html
<div class="card">
  <h2>Article Title</h2>
  <p>This is an example of using a &lt;div&gt; tag as a container.</p>
</div>
```

**Note:**
We’ll later learn the difference between **Block Elements** vs **Inline Elements**.
The `<div>` tag is a **block-level element**, meaning it automatically starts on a new line.

### The `<span>` Tag – Inline Text Container

The `<span>` tag is used to **style a small portion of text** or a specific inline element without creating a line break.

**Example:**

```html
<p>This is a <span style="color: red;">red-colored</span> text.</p>
```

**Main Difference:**

* `<div>` → Used to group large sections or elements.
* `<span>` → Used to style small portions of text.

When you start building web pages, you’ll rely heavily on these tags, since most modern web layouts are based on using `<div>` to divide the page into sections — such as the header, main content, sidebar, and footer.
Then, you use CSS to control the **positioning, colors, and size** of each part.

**Example:**

```html
<div class="header">Header</div>
<div class="content">Main Content</div>
<div class="footer">Footer</div>
```

*In short:*
`<div>` and `<span>` are **the foundation of any HTML layout**, and what brings them to life is **CSS**, which turns them into a complete, well-designed web page.

## Uses of Semantic Elements

As we’ve seen examples of semantic elements in HTML, now it’s time to explore how each of these elements is used.

### 1. The `<header>` Tag – Page or Section Header

The `<header>` tag is used to create **the top section or introduction of a page**, which usually contains elements that introduce the website or make navigation easier.

Inside a `<header>`, you can include elements such as:

* **The main heading** of the page or website (like `<h1>` or `<h2>`).
* **The logo** or site icon.
* **Navigation links** that help users move to different parts of the site.
* Or even information about the author or the content.

**Example:**

```html
<header>
  <h1>CodeZelo Title</h1>
  <img src="CodeZelo-logo.png" alt="CodeZelo Logo">
  <nav>
    <a href="#about">About</a>
    <a href="#projects">Projects</a>
    <a href="#contact">Contact</a>
  </nav>
</header>
```

You can use more than one `<header>` on the same page — for example, one at the top of the main page, and another inside an article or a specific section.

{{< alert >}}
**Note:**
You should **not** place a `<header>` inside another `<header>`, `<footer>`, or `<address>`.
{{</ alert >}}

In short, `<header>` acts as the **introductory section** of any page or content block, helping users quickly understand where they are and how to navigate through the site.

### 2. The `<nav>` Tag – Navigation Menu

The `<nav>` tag in HTML is used to define a **navigation section** of the page.

Simply put, it’s the part that helps users **move between different pages or sections** of the website — like the top navigation bar you see on the CodeZelo website.

Inside `<nav>`, you can include links that take the user to places like: the Home page, About Us, Services, Contact, and so on.

**Example:**

```html
<nav>
  <a href="index.html">Home</a>
  <a href="about.html">About</a>
  <a href="services.html">Services</a>
  <a href="contact.html">Contact</a>
</nav>
```

{{< alert >}}
Not every link on your page should be inside `<nav>`.
This tag is meant **only for main navigation links**, not for random links within the content.
{{</ alert >}}

Another benefit is that browsers and screen readers (used by people with disabilities) can recognize `<nav>` and handle it intelligently — improving **user experience and accessibility**.

In short, `<nav>` is the section that contains your site’s **primary navigation links**, keeping your HTML clean, organized, and easy to understand — both for browsers and developers.

### 3. The `<main>` Tag – Main Content Area

The `<main>` tag is used to define the **main content** of a web page — the part that the visitor actually came to see.

The content inside `<main>` should be **unique and specific** to that page, and it **should not include** repeated elements that appear on every page, like sidebars, navigation menus, logos, or copyright notices.

**Example:**

```html
<main>
  <h1>Welcome to My Blog</h1>
  <p>In this article, we’ll discuss the basics of HTML for beginners.</p>
</main>
```

**Important Notes:**

* There should only be **one `<main>`** element per page.
* You should **not** place `<main>` inside elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, or `<article>`.

In short, `<main>` is the **heart of the page** — it holds the core content that users are there for, and it helps search engines and screen readers quickly identify where the important information is.

### 4. The `<section>` Tag – A Subsection Within the Page

The `<section>` tag in HTML is used to create a **section (part)** within a webpage that groups together a set of related elements.

So, if you have a long page containing different topics, you can divide it into sections using `<section>` to make your code more organized and clear.

Each `<section>` usually contains a **heading** (like `<h2>` or `<h3>`) and some content related to that same idea.

**Simple Example:**

```html
<section>
  <h2>About the Website</h2>
  <p>This website is designed to help beginners learn HTML in a simple and easy way.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Our Services</h2>
  <p>We offer lessons and practical examples in web design and development.</p>
</section>
```

**Important Notes:**

* The `<section>` tag is a **semantic element**, meaning it tells the browser and search engines the purpose of that part of the page.
* It helps organize the content logically, making the code easier to read and maintain.

In short, `<section>` is a **tag used to divide a webpage into related parts**, each with a clear topic or idea.

### 5. The `<article>` Tag – An Independent Piece of Content

The `<article>` tag is used to define **self-contained content**, meaning a section of the page that can stand on its own and still make sense even if viewed separately from the rest of the page.

Content placed inside an `<article>` is usually something like:

* A blog post
* A news report or article
* A forum post
* Or even a comment or standalone social media post

**Simple Example:**

```html
<article>
  <h2>The Importance of Learning HTML</h2>
  <p>HTML is the first step for anyone who wants to enter the world of web development. Without it, no website can function properly.</p>
</article>
```

{{< alert >}}
The `<article>` tag doesn’t have a special visual style in browsers, but it helps **organize your content** and makes your code clearer and more professional.
Of course, you can use CSS to style it and control its appearance.
{{< /alert >}}

In short, `<article>` is the tag used for **independent and complete content** within a page — like an article or news piece — that can be displayed on its own without losing its meaning.

### 6. The `<aside>` Tag – Sidebar or Supplementary Content

The `<aside>` tag is used to add **side content** or **additional information** that’s related to the main content, but not directly part of it.

A common use of `<aside>` is as a **sidebar** on a webpage — just like what you see in blogs or news websites.

**Simple Example:**

```html
<article>
  <h2>Learn HTML Step by Step</h2>
  <p>HTML is the foundation of building any website...</p>

  <aside>
    <h3>Quick Tip</h3>
    <p>Always start your page with the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration.</p>
  </aside>
</article>
```

**Important Notes:**

* The content inside `<aside>` is **indirectly related** to the main content.
* It doesn’t have a special appearance in the browser by default, but you can **style it using CSS** to make it look like a sidebar or a separate box.

In short, `<aside>` is the perfect place for any **extra information or side notes** that support the main content without being part of it directly.

### 7. The `<footer>` Tag – Page or Section Footer

The `<footer>` tag is used to define the **footer of a page or section** — the part that usually appears at the bottom and contains identifying or important information.

Content inside a `<footer>` might include:

* Author information or copyright details
* Contact links or social media links
* Quick links (like “Back to Top” or “Privacy Policy”)
* A site map or related document links

You can even use **multiple `<footer>` elements** on the same page —
for example, one at the **bottom of the entire page**, and another **inside a specific article or section**.

**Simple Example:**

```html
<footer>
  <p>© 2025 All Rights Reserved – Learn HTML Website</p>
  <a href="#top">Back to Top ↑</a>
</footer>
```

{{< alert >}}
The `<footer>` tag doesn’t have a default visual style in browsers, but you can use **CSS** to style it so it appears neatly organized at the bottom of the page.
{{< /alert >}}

In short, `<footer>` is where you place the **ending part or final information** related to the page or section it belongs to.

## Summary

After seeing the **differences between semantic and non-semantic tags**, you might ask yourself:
Should I rely on just one type and ignore the other?

Of course not. These tags are designed to **complement each other**, not to replace one another.

When you start working on real-world coding projects, you’ll find yourself using **both types effectively**.
With practice and by following proper HTML coding standards, you’ll learn **when to use semantic tags and when to use standard ones**.

In the next lesson, we’ll talk about **Content & Text Elements** — and how to control the appearance of text using HTML tags.
