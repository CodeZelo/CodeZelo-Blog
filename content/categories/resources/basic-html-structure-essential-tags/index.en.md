Any **web page** is, at its core, an **HTML document**.
That’s why it’s important to understand the essential tags that every page must include.

Let’s start with a simple example of the most basic HTML page you can create:

![The simplest HTML page](/basic-html-structure-essential-tags.png "The simplest HTML page")

From this example, we can see that there are **five essential tags** every web page should contain:

* The document type declaration `DOCTYPE`
* The `<html>` tag – the root element of the page
* The `<head>` tag – contains metadata and page information
* The `<title>` tag – defines the page title shown in the browser
* The `<body>` tag – holds all the visible content for visitors

## Declaring the Document Type – `<!DOCTYPE html>`

The `<!DOCTYPE>` is **not** an HTML tag — it’s a **declaration** written at the very top of every HTML document.
Its purpose is to tell the browser:

> “Hey browser, this page is written in a specific version of HTML.”

In other words, it’s **information for the browser** that defines which version of HTML the page uses, so it can render the content properly.

In older versions like HTML 4.01, the `DOCTYPE` declaration was long and complicated because it relied on something called a DTD (Document Type Definition).
But in HTML5, it became much simpler — all you need to write is:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

That line tells the browser that the page is written in **HTML5**, and that’s all it needs for modern browsers to display the page consistently.

> In short: `<!DOCTYPE>` is an **instruction for the browser** — it doesn’t appear to the user, but it’s essential for the page to work correctly.


## The `<html>` Tag – The Root Element of the Page

The `<html>` tag marks the true beginning of any web page.
You can think of it as the **foundation** on which all other elements are built. That’s why it’s called the **root element** of an HTML document.

This tag consists of two parts:

* `<html>` – the opening tag
* `</html>` – the closing tag

Everything on the page — text, images, headings, and all other elements — must be placed between these two tags.

Inside the `<html>` element, you’ll usually find two main sections:

* `<head>` – contains information *about* the page (like the title or linked CSS files).
* `<body>` – contains the content that is *visible* to users.

Without the `<html>` tag, the page wouldn’t even qualify as an HTML document.


## The `<head>` Tag – Contains Page Information

The `<head>` tag is where you place **information about the web page itself**, not the content users see on the screen.
It’s the section that provides data for the browser and search engines — things like the title, description, and encoding type.

Common elements inside the `<head>` include:

* `<title>` – defines the title shown in the browser tab or search results.
* `<meta>` – specifies details like the page description, keywords, or character encoding.
* `<link>` – connects the page to external files such as CSS stylesheets.
* `<style>` – allows you to include CSS rules directly within the page.
* `<script>` – adds JavaScript functionality to the page.

Here’s a simple example:

```html
<head>  
  <title>Simple Page</title>  
  <meta charset="UTF-8">  
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
```

> In short: the `<head>` tag is responsible for all the **settings and information** that help the page function and display correctly — **but it’s not visible to users**.


## The `<title>` Tag – The Page Title in the Browser

The `<title>` tag defines the **title of the web page**, which appears at the top of the browser tab.
It’s also the title that shows up when you **bookmark the page** or when it appears in **search engine results**.

This tag must be placed **inside the `<head>` section**, for example:

```html
<head>
  <title>Beginner’s Guide to HTML</title>
</head>
```

The page title isn’t just for looks — it’s also **very important for SEO (Search Engine Optimization)**.
A well-written title helps your page appear more prominently in search results.

**Tips for writing a strong title:**

* Make it **descriptive and clear**.
* Keep it around **50–60 characters** long.
* Use connected words that accurately describe your page’s content.

> In short: the `<title>` tag gives your page its **identity** — both for users and for search engines.


## The `<body>` Tag – The Visible Content for Users

The `<body>` tag is where you put **all the content that users actually see** on a web page — headings, paragraphs, images, tables, links, lists, and more.

It always comes **after the `<head>` section**, and there should only be **one `<body>`** tag per page.

Example:

```html
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
  <p>This is a simple sample paragraph.</p>
  <img src="photo.jpg" alt="Illustrative image">
</body>
```

> Everything you see in the browser exists inside the `<body>` tag.
> Simply put, the `<body>` is the **heart of the page** — it contains everything the user sees and interacts with.
