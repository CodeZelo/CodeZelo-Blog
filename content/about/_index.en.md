Hey there ðŸ‘‹ I'm **Mahmoud**, a developer who believes learning to code shouldnâ€™t be complicated.  
Thatâ€™s why I created **CodeZelo** â€” a space to make programming easier, clearer, and more human.
{{< /lead >}}

When I first started learning web development, I spent countless hours trying to make sense of scattered tutorials and confusing documentation.  
I realized that what most developers need isnâ€™t *more content* â€” itâ€™s **better explanations**.

Here at **CodeZelo**, I share:
- Practical tutorials in **Frontend**, **Backend**, and **Fullstack** development.  
- Insights about **AI tools** and how they can improve your workflow.  
- Real experiences, lessons learned, and honest advice for new developers.

## ðŸŽ¯ My Goal
To make coding feel approachable and enjoyable â€”  
to simplify complex ideas and help developers grow confidently.  
Because programming isnâ€™t just about writing code;  
itâ€™s about **thinking, building, and creating**. ðŸ’¡
